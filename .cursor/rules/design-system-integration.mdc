# External Design System Rules

- Prefer consuming shared tokens/components from the external design system before adding local variants.
- Keep token mapping centralized in one theme source file when app code exists.
- If a required token is missing, add a temporary fallback and document it.
- Do not hardcode colors/spacing values that already exist in external tokens.
