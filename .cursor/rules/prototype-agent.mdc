# Prototype Agent Rules

## Scope
- Prefer the simplest end-to-end implementation first
- Keep features small and iterative
- Avoid speculative abstractions

## Safety
- Never commit secrets or tokens
- Use `.env.local` for local secrets
- Keep `.env.example` updated with placeholder keys

## Delivery
- Make focused changes for one feature at a time
- Add short docs updates when behavior changes
- Keep commit messages descriptive
